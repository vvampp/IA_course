Properties of Red-Black Trees

1. Each node is either Red or Black
2. The root is always Black
3. Every leaf (NIL) is Black
4. If a node ir Red, both children must be Black
5. Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes must have the same amount of black nodes


Relevant formulas

- h <= 2h_b
- n >= 2^h_b - 1

where h_b (black height) is the minimum number of black nodes from the root to a leaf

on solving this equations:

- h <= 2log_2(n+1)
